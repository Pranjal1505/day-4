- Enabled Telnet Client (for testing purposes).

- Created a Firewall Rule to block inbound TCP Port 23 (Telnet).

- Tested Telnet Connections:

- Before rule: Successful connection (telnet 50.0.0.1).

- After rule: Blocked connection (telnet 50.0.0.1).

- Verified Security Impact: Ensured only Telnet was blocked while other services remained unaffected.
